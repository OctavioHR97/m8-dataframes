# Exercise 4: Working with Data Frames

# Load R's "USPersonalExpenditure" dataest using the `data()` function
data("USPersonalExpenditure")

# The variable USPersonalExpenditure is now accessible to you. Unfortunately, it's not a data.frame
# Test this using the is.data.frame function
is.data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)

# Luckily, you can simply pass the USPersonalExpenditure variable to the data.frame function
# to convert it a data.farme
# Create a new variable by passing the USPersonalExpenditure to the data.frame function
US.pers.exp <- data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)

# What are the column names of your dataframe?
colnames(US.pers.exp)

# Why are they so strange?


# What are the row names of your dataframe?
rownames(US.pers.exp)

# Create a column `category` that is equal to your rownames
US.pers.exp$category <- rownames(US.pers.exp)

# How much money was spent on personal care in 1940?
p.care.1940 <- US.pers.exp['Personal Care', 'X1940']

# How much money was spent on Food and Tobacco in 1960
ft.1960 <- US.pers.exp['Food and Tobacco', 'X1960']

# What was the highest expenditure category in 1960?
highest.exp.1960 <- US.pers.exp$category[US.pers.exp$X1960 == max(US.pers.exp$X1960)]

### Bonus ###

# Write a function that takes in a year as a parameter, and 
# returns the highest spending category of that year
Highest <- function(year){
  return(US.pers.exp$category[US.pers.exp[year] == max(US.pers.exp[year])])
}

# Using your function, determine the highest spending category of each year


# Write a loop to cycle through the years, and store the highest spending category of
# each year in a list
